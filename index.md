Welcome! My name is Jiwon Lee and I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Sociology at Johns Hopkins University. <br>

I study topics in  social stratification, demography, public opinion, immigration, and sociology of education. In my dissertation, I examine how social and demographic change during the last half-century has shaped current politics in the United States.  
   
My work has appeared in *Sociological Methods and Research*, *Sociological Science*, and *Socius*. To learn more about my research and teaching, you can find my [CV](/cv_jiwonlee.pdf), list of [publications](https://jiwonlee.net/research/), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nszIX_sAAAAJ&hl=en) profile, and [teaching experiences](https://jiwonlee.net/teaching/).

Welcome! I am the Frank H. T. Rhodes Postdoctoral Fellow at the Cornell Population Center, Cornell University, where I am mentored by [Matthew Hall](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/people/matthew-hall/). I earned my Ph.D. in Sociology from Johns Hopkins University in May 2023, under the guidance of [Stephen L. Morgan](http://socweb.soc.jhu.edu/faculty/morgan/). My research focuses on social stratification, demography, public opinion, immigration, race/ethnicity, and sociology of education, with a specialization in causal inference and demographic methods. 

For 2025â€“2026, I will serve as a co-PI, alongside Matt Hall (PI), on a Russell Sage Foundation-funded project using restricted-use Census Bureau datasets to study the [racial and ethnic identification of multiracial Americans](https://www.russellsage.org/awarded-project/context-and-life-course-racialethnic-identities-among-multi-racial-americans).

My work has been published in *Social Science Research*, *Sociological Methods & Research*, *Sociological Science*, and *Socius*. To learn more about my research and teaching experiences, you can explore my [CV](/cv_jiwon_lee.pdf), [publications](https://jiwonlee.net/research/), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nszIX_sAAAAJ&hl=en) profile, and [teaching experience](https://jiwonlee.net/teaching/).

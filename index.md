Welcome! I am the Frank H. T. Rhodes Postdoctoral Fellow at the Cornell Population Center, Cornell University, where I am mentored by [Matthew Hall](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/people/matthew-hall/). I earned my Ph.D. in Sociology from Johns Hopkins University in May 2023, under the guidance of [Stephen L. Morgan](http://socweb.soc.jhu.edu/faculty/morgan/). My research focuses on social stratification, demography, public opinion, immigration, race/ethnicity, and sociology of education, with a specialization in causal inference and demographic methods.  

My work has been published in *Social Science Research*, *Sociological Methods & Research*, *Sociological Science*, and *Socius*. You can learn more about my research and teaching experiences through the following links:

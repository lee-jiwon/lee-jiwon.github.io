Welcome! I am currently the Frank H. T. Rhodes Postdoctoral Fellow at the Cornell Population Center, Cornell University, with Matthew Hall as my mentor. I earned my Ph.D. in sociology from Johns Hopkins University in May 2023, under the guidance of Stephen L. Morgan. I study topics in  social stratification, demography, public opinion, immigration, and sociology of education, with a methodological specialization in causal inference and demographic methods.  <br>

In my dissertation, I examine how social and demographic change during the last half-century has shaped contemporary U.S. politics. 
   
My work has appeared in *Social Science Research*, *Sociological Methods and Research*, *Sociological Science*, and *Socius*.
